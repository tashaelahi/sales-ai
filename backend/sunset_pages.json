PODCAST QUOTE GENERATOR Call us Menu Sunset 17 Bookings: 949-391-2312 Home / Services / Website & Podcast Integration Content Creation For Business Website & Podcast Integration The most important distribution channel for your podcast is your website. Business gets done on a website. That\u2019s why it\u2019s crucial to ensure your podcast lives on and is promoted through your website first, and then shared across other platforms. While platforms like YouTube, Instagram, and LinkedIn are great for exposure, they aren\u2019t where business transactions happen. Your website is where the real connections are made and value is created. Get Started Website development Our team has years of experience building new websites that take full advantage of podcast content. Whether you are using the content to educate your customers, sell educational content, or support your e-commerce store, we can help. Some of our favorite platforms include Shopify, WordPress, and Kajabi but build on other platforms as well depending on your needs. Podcast Integration Our in-house design and development team are experts at integrating podcasts into existing websites. We\u2019ll make sure that the new content aligns with your brand\u2019s look and feel, is organized into the navigation, and is optimized for search engine optimization (SEO). Frequently Asked Questions What is the benefit of adding podcasts to my site vs posting on social media? When you post your podcast clips on social media we recommend linking to your website where the full episode lives. Once they visit your website you are much more likely to build a relationship with the visitor and eventually sell them your product or service. Can I automatically update new podcast episodes on my website? It depends on what you want the user experience to be like. It is possible to use an RSS feed integration to automatically display and update new episodes on your website without manually adding each one. Can I customize the look and feel of the podcast player? We suggest using Youtube embedded videos for your podcast and short clips. This means you do not have to host the videos yourself and you can cross promote your Youtube channel as well. How long does it take to integrate my podcast into my website? The timeline can vary depending on your website\u2019s setup and any custom features you need.
